# üç≤ FoodStore (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile)

FoodSore is a lightweight demo app crafted to showcase how to build cross-platform mobile applications using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) with a shared Jetpack Compose UI for both Android and iOS üöÄ.



## About 

This application retrieves a list of posts from a remote API, syncs the data with local storage using SQLite, and always displays data from the local source. The app ensures data is available even when offline.

**Features:**

- [x] Offline capability üìµ
- [x] Dark mode üåì
- [x] Clean and Simple Material UI üé®

The network API is a dummy (fixed) response which is _statically hosted
[here](https://patilshreyas.github.io/DummyFoodiumApi/api/posts/)_. The concept of this app is
originally taken from [this project](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/Foodium/).

### üì± Preview

Currently, the app looks like this on the both platforms:

## Project structure 

This Compose Multiplatform project includes three modules:

### [`shared`](/shared)
This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, the code you share between platforms.
This shared module is also where you write your Compose Multiplatform code. In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.
It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`. The shared module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### [`androidApp`](/androidApp)
This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.

### [`iosApp`](/iosApp)
This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as a CocoaPods dependency.
